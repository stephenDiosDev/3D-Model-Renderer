# 3D-Model-Renderer
A renderer written with C++, OpenGL and GLSL shaders (the model loader was provided). 

This renderer implements Flat, Gouraud and Phong shading.
Some models contain textures which also get applied (if the model has textures)

NOTE: With the exception of a few edits and additions, the main code written by me is the non-boilerplate code in main.cpp (plus the controls) and the phong, gouraud, and flat glsl shader files. In addition, I also wrote code to calculate vertex normals in obj_mesh.cpp

All other code was provided by the TA.
