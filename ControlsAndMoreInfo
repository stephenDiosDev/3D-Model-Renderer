I wasn't able to implement switching models via keys, which means it requires some commenting and uncommenting
of code. When you want to switch between models and their textures, you must modify 3 parts of code
in main.cpp by commenting/uncommenting as described below:

TO CHANGE MODELS:
Line 400 in main.cpp has all 4 models listed. Comment out every model you don't want, so the only
enabled line is the model you want.

TO CHANGE TEXTURES:
Line 467 in main.cpp has the 3 texture files listed. Enable them similarly to models when you want
to use them for their respective model.

TO CHANGE SHADING BETWEEN SHADING WITH TEXTURES AND SHADING WITHOUT TEXTURES:
Line 520 in main.cpp has 2 sections. The first block is when you want to use any shading with textures enabled,
and the second block is when you want to use any shading with textures disabled. Make sure you only have 1 block
enabled at a time!
